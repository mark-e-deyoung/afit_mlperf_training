This directory contains scripts to download and install
the CUDA API in your home directory (${HOME}/opt).

This is so you can use alternative API versions
with the GNU environment modules system.

Example module files are in the privatemodules 
directory.  Copy these to your ${HOME}/privatemodules
directory.
